    "In the rapidly evolving field of aviation, regulatory bodies such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States, Transport Canada (TC), and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) frequently update their policies, regulations, and safety guidelines. These changes are crucial for maintaining the highest standards of safety, efficiency, and compliance within the aviation industry. Aviation training organizations and educational institutions must constantly monitor and incorporate these updates into their curriculum to ensure that professionals are learning the most current and relevant information.\n",

    "### Features of the Citation Tracking and Validation Script\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Comprehensive Change Tracking:** The script is capable of monitoring and identifying changes not only to the text within the cited sources from FAA and other aviation authorities but also to images, including visual charts and statistical information. This ensures a holistic update of all forms of content that might impact aviation training and education.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Link Tracking:** It efficiently tracks the URLs or links embedded within these sources, ensuring that all external references remain current and accessible. This feature is critical for maintaining the integrity of the citation and the reliability of the content provided to clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **User-Friendly Citation Input:** Users can easily input citation links into the database, making it simple to specify which sources need monitoring for updates or changes. This input process is designed to be intuitive and accessible, allowing for a broad range of users to effectively manage their citation tracking needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Automated Weekly Updates:** The script is programmed to conduct checks for changes on a weekly basis automatically. This frequency ensures that updates are caught and reported in a timely manner, without inundating users with too much information or requiring daily monitoring efforts.\n",
    " \n",
    "5. **Reliable Information Delivery:** By providing up-to-date changes from authoritative sources, the script ensures that clients always have access to the most current and reliable information. This is essential for organizations that depend on the latest regulatory updates to maintain compliance and instructional relevance in the fast-paced aviation industry."

The ACIP will support continued investments by these airports during the COVID-19 pandemic and will support the recovery of their sector, without further worsening their financial challenges. This will provide several benefits, such as:\n",
